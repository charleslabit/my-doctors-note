          "Us," "Our"), exclusively operates the domain MedExcuse.com
          (hereinafter referred to as "Website"). Said digital infrastructure
          solely facilitates the automated rendering of template-based
          documentation predicated upon user-inputted informational variables.
          We neither engage in the practice of medicine, nor are we recognized
          as a licensed healthcare entity or a legally sanctioned institution
          capable of authenticating medical conditions or absences. <br />
          <br /> At no juncture do we undertake medical assessments, dispense
          medical counsel, or issue officially recognized documentation. The
          exclusive function of this service remains confined to the algorithmic
          generation of pre-structured document templates strictly for academic
          and referential purposes.
